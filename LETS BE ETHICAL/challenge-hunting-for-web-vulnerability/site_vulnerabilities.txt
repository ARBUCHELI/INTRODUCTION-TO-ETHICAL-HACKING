1. Password field does not hide user's password
2. When you place `jake@newcomsolutions.com` in the email field and a wrong password, the error message inform us that there is a user with the 
email `jake@newcomsolutions.com`
3. The site is prone to SQL injection. Inserting the SQL code '1' OR '1' = '1' within the password field outputted all the account information.
